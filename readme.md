# SKILLS LEARNED

- How to use uWebsockets.js for websocket connection
- Created a Publish/Subscribe protocol for client messaging based on different topic types.
- Learned to parsed data from backend to frontend with JSON and
- Developed "rooms" generated by user with specialized join codes
- Automatic cleanup of messages and rooms after it becomes empty
- Connect frontend client to server with heroku
- Strengthen git understanding with different branches and remotes

# Lessons Learned

- Planning the publish/subscribe protocol topics ahead of time is every necessary. It makes code writing harder as you have to go back and add it in.
- Create a variable file to not lose places of them

# Reflection

Learning about websockets, TLS/SSL connections, publish/subscribe protocols, and learning uWebSockets.js has been an incredible learning journey packed with knowledge. I'm amazed at what can be done with websockets and creating a websocket chatroom has been a great ice breaker into the new territory. This project shown me there is nothing to be fear from the backend. I want to improve in my backend servers and learn to develop with redis for scaling. It was the funner project I have had in a while especially the first moment when I could see the messages sent from the second localhost page!
